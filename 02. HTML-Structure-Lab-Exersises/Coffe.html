    <h1>The Best Coffee Regions</h1>
</div>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h2>Brazil</h2>
        <p>Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about 85% of the production;
            robusta accounts for the remaining 30%. In Brazil, arabica production is located
            in the main coffee-growing cluster of states led by Rio where arabica is
            produced almost exclusively. Robusta is primarily grown in the northwestern much smaller
            state of Espirito Santo where about 80% of the coffee is robusta.</p>

        <h2>Columbia</h2>
        <p>Colombia has a reputation as producing mild, well balanced coffee beans.Colombia's
            average annual coffee production of 11.5 million bags is the third total highest in the world,
            after Brazil and Vietnam; though highest in terms of the arabica
            bean. The beans are exported to United States, Germany, France, Japan, and Italy.
            Most coffee is grown in the Colombian coffee growing axis region.</p>

        <h2>India</h2>
        <p>Indian coffee, grown mostly in southern India under monsoon rainfall conditions,
            is also termed as Indian monsooned coffee". Its flavor is defined as:
            "At its best similar to the flavor characteristics of Pacific coffees,
            but at its worst bland and uninspiring. The two well known species of coffee grown are the Arabica and
            Robusta.
            Probably the most commonly planted Arabica in India and Southeast Asia is S.795.</p>

        <h2>Costa Rica</h2>
        <p>Costa Rican coffee beans are considered among the best in the world. Tarrazu is thought to produce the most
            desirable coffee beans in Costa Rica. In 2012, Tarrazu Geisha coffee became the most expensive coffee sold
            by Starbucks in 48 of their stores in the United States, using the Clover automated French press.
            The finest coffee is typically grown at altitudes of 1200 to 1700 meters.</p>
